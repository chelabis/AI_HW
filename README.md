## 1- HW1- Student Performance Prediction
### Supervised Regression problem, dataset: Student_Performance.csv


## 2- HW2- Adult Income Classification
### Supervised Classification problem, dataset: adult_income.csv

#### Detail: An individual’s annual income results from various factors. Intuitively, it is influenced by the individual’s education level, age, gender, occupation, etc. In this dataset, you can find some individuals classified incomes(income <= 50K or income > 50K) alongside their respective influential features.
#### Task 1: Clean the data, use any statistical, visualization and preprocessing techniques.
#### Task 2: Find the best classification model for this data and report its performance measures on the validation set.


## 3- HW3- Customer Segmentation
### Unsupervised clustering problem, dataset: Wholesale customers data.csv

#### Dataset description:
This dataset contains information about customers' annual spending on various product categories.
#### Dataset Features:
 * Channel: The distribution channel (Retail or Horeca)
 * Region: The region of the customer
 * Fresh: Annual spending on fresh products
 * Milk: Annual spending on milk products
 * Grocery: Annual spending on grocery products
 * Frozen: Annual spending on frozen products
 * Detergents_Paper: Annual spending on detergents and paper products
 * Delicatessen: Annual spending on delicatessen products

#### Task 1: Preprocess and clean the data
#### Task 2: Use anomaly detection techniques to find the abnormal instances
#### Task 3: Use sufficient clustering models for customer segmentation regarding the processed dataset
#### Task 4: Use dimensionality reduction techniques to present the results


## 4- HW4- Deep Neural Networks
### Part 1- Unsupervised clustering problem, dataset: Wholesale customers data.csv
### Part 2- 

Churn data:

This is the dataset of the customers in a company. Our goal is to predict whether a customer will exit the company regarding a set of measured features.

Task 1: clean and process the data

Task 2: construct and train a fully connected Neural Network for predicting the customer churn and optimize it

Task 3: calculate the performance measures and analyze the results
